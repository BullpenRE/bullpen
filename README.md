# Welcome to the Bullpen Rails App

### Introduction
This app was intended to replace a no-code bubble.io app for [Bullpen Real Estate](https://www.bullpenre.com/) but 
a few weeks before the scheduled release it was decided for business reasons to not move forward with the replacement, and instead use it as a portfolio piece for the
awesome team of engineers and designers that made it happen. It is almost fully built (about 90%) but has a few minor pieces of functionality missing.

You can see this application in action on Heroku at http://bullpen-staging.herokuapp.com. NOTE: In order to prevent potential abuse this application cannot send out any emails. In order to test the user experience 
for a freelancer, use me@freelancer.com with password `Password1!`. To see the view of an employer you can use me@employer.com also with the password `Password1!`.
